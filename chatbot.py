BUGS:     
    
Repetition   
- Let's not worry about this for now as it doesn't break any of the criteria. But it is still important to consider.   
    
TASKS   
Create and give functionality to four arrays:    
    
messageWords - Handles the short term memory of the text.   
    
LongTermMemory - Not necessary at this stage. Though it is certainly possible to create if necessary.   
    
HumanFacts - Facts about the human   
    -Added whenever a (human) personal pronoun is followed by a fact-oriented verb (am), OR a humanContraction (I'm)   
BotFacts - Facts about the bot   
    -Added whenever a (bot) personal pronoun is followed by a fact-oriented verb (are), OR a botContraction (you're)   
WorldFacts - Facts about everything else   
    -Hardest to implement. For now you could just store full sentences containing a fact-oriented verb (is, are).   
    
In the future: Learning details about other people   
    -If clarification is needed due to the use of a pronoun, the chatbot can ask "Who are you referring to?"   
    
Let's implement all of these as sets of words.   
    
    
For now:   
We want do the following:   
From the most recent message:   
    -Check for any of the following:   
        -A humanContraction or botContraction   
        -A combo of pronoun and verb   
        -Anything containing is or are.   
    -If the fact is about the human, then record it in humanFacts   
    -Otherwise, if it is a bot, record it in botFacts   
    -Otherwise, if it is a world fact, record it in worldFacts   
       
    How to test and record the message:   
        1. Scan the split version of the message, messageWords (try it out in a separate compiler first)   
        2. Copy the full message into the appropriate (long-term) fact file. Eventually we should be more specific about the info we collect.

#BEFORE YOU START:
#I recommend grouping variables by their type, so that they can be used easily in functions:
#E.g. any variable that describes the message itself should referenced as a list of relevant variables, or alternatively, a struct.
  #After all, the entire point of all of this is to categorise the message type, in order to construct an appropriate response.
